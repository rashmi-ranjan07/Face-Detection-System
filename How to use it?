!! Download IP Webcam in your mobile !!
Create a folder named as face detection
or
You can use spyproject where you can directly create a new project with name face detection. 

There you just need to create 2 files -
-Clean data (After consolidating the data or images it would dump into this folder)
-images (for collecting the raw images)

At first download the xml file with this link - https://github.com/rashmi-ranjan07/Face-Detection-System/blob/main/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
The xml file must be present in face detection project

After that open the collect_data file -  https://github.com/rashmi-ranjan07/Face-Detection-System/blob/main/collect_data.py

Here the code is already present you just need to change the classifier path(xml file) as well as url ip address 
(Note: The ip address can be fetched through the IP Webcam Mobile App)
Now collect the images (100 of images will be collected if it doesn't match to 100 images then it will show "need more data".
After collecting 100 of images it will automatically be saved and name the file name according to your need.

Then open the consolidated_data file where you can dumop the files into images.p and labels.p.
The consolidated_data file is in this link- https://github.com/rashmi-ranjan07/Face-Detection-System/blob/main/consolidated_data.py
After running it it would create two files with .p extensions which would be present in Clean data

Then training the model where you can just train in google colab or you can use jupyter notebook
The training model can be found in this link - https://github.com/rashmi-ranjan07/Face-Detection-System/blob/main/Training%20the%20model/face_detection.ipynb
Here you just need to change the path where your images.p and labels.p is present then after training the model the model is dumped into 'final_modelh5'
(Note : In lenet_model function - Just change the output layer where '7' is written change it with how many number of images with different persons you have collected and saved)

Then implement this model in recognize.py

The recognize.py file can be found in this link - https://github.com/rashmi-ranjan07/Face-Detection-System/blob/main/recognize.py

In this file you just need to change the classifier path (xml file), model path(where your model is present (final_model.h5)) and url path(from the IP Webcam).

Just name the labels as per your requirements
(Note : This labels are the names, where  you have saved your images files i.e, if you have collected multiple images of different persons then you have saved with different names.Thus, you need to give those names in labels.)

And then you can check the outtput in your laptop screen where the input (i.e, the face can be from the app IP Webcam which is in your mobile) is given and output can be achieved in your screen (i.e, the face name).
